wont be maintained after a new captcha update ---- the jannies are lazy so you can use this for the next yearl


**I can only share this**

I recomend installing violentmonkey
use the 60%slop.user.js
  
  its jsut a retarded extention , the jannies cant do nothing that wont be adopted in a short time , an hour to adopt? 

[X] I cannot share Datasets used in the process // jupyter notebooks! 

[X] Cannot share the python version

[V] fucked up sharing this , anyways it works  , and it works great , 

[V] this solver is working , even after adding artificial noise , due to the nature of opencv 

[Wontfix , to protect Owo.vg ] -- added preproccing opencv on the "diff challenge" 

[dear 4chan jannies] your captchas are , too hard,  in a sense that ,.... **they are too long , it takes 20seconsd to solve it** ,

the captchas are solved pretty easily 
 99.78% (2544 total real samples , on the python version  )
